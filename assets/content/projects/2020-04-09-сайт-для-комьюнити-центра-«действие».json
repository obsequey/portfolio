  "body": "My first serious work with headless WordPress and Vue (yeah, not Nuxt) and can be treated as some degree of a failure. \n\nI also worked for the first time with a designer, and, boy, it is difficult to explain how someone should do something to make your life as a developer easier, not at the cost of the design, of course.\n\nI was very surprised how hard it was for me to wrap my head around WordPress Rest API as I do not know PHP that well (and I needed custom endpoints). So I consider myself very persistent to even complete this work.\n\nAnother interesting thing to notice is the necessity to make multiple API endpoint calls to get multiple data, and the size of responses. I guess, to improve this I will use GraphQL in the next project.",
